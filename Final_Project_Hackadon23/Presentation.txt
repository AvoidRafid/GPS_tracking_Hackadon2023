PITCH TALK:


For Those Chasing Time:

Like millions of others navigating the hustle of commuting every day, I too was living my own story in this modern world where time is of the essence.
Buses arriving at the last minute, followed by the anxiety of missing them – these troubles had become part of this urban life.

Every day, we are trying to get somewhere on time but sometimes we couldn't make it. 

 What if I could track buses in real-time?
 What if I could have instant information about where they are headed and the routes they are on? 

At this point, Our team “INTFINITY”  came up with a solution to overcome this issue.

Knowing where the busses are can reduce the anxiety of missing them.

Perhaps when you're trying to catch the bus, maybe you could even talk to our voice assistant GENIE! Or when you're bored at the bus stop!

Without futher delay, let us enlighten you with our ideas!

I present you, Amar!


PRESENTATION IDEAS:
Hello everyone,
Having the power to track the location of your bus in real-time, allowing you to make more informed decisions about your daily travel.


1. Geopoints Generator Function:
Our application starts with a sophisticated geopoints generator function. We use the capabilities of the Open Source Routing Machine, we create precise geopoints that represent the optimal route for you. This ensures that the routes are not only accurate but also efficiently generated for your travel with personal vehicle.


2. Traffic Jam Detection:
What sets us apart is our ability to analyze traffic conditions in real-time. By integrating various datasets, we monitor these geopoints for any signs of traffic congestion. This allows us to pinpoint potential delays and disruptions in the bus route with a color. Green to vicious red.


3. Interactive Map Display:
The information gathered is then seamlessly presented on an interactive map. Users can easily visualize the current location of active buses and identify areas of traffic congestion. This intuitive display makes it convenient for commuters to plan their journeys more effectively.
