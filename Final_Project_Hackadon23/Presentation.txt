PITCH TALK:


For Those Chasing Time:

Like millions of others navigating the hustle of commuting every day, I too was living my own story in this modern world where time is of the essence.
Buses arriving at the last minute, followed by the anxiety of missing them – these troubles had become part of this urban life.

Every day, we are trying to get somewhere on time but sometimes we couldn't make it. 

 What if I could track buses in real-time?
 What if I could have instant information about where they are headed and the routes they are on? 

At this point, Our team “INTFINITY”  came up with a solution to overcome this issue.

Knowing where the busses are can reduce the anxiety of missing them.

Perhaps when you're trying to catch the bus, maybe you could even talk to our voice assistant GENIE! Or when you're bored at the bus stop!

Without futher delay, let us enlighten you with our ideas!

I present you, Amar!



Conclusion:
Our Real-Time Bus Tracker is not just an application; it's a tool designed to enhance the overall experience of Bus Stop :)). 
Say goodbye to uncertainties and hello to a more informed and efficient VGI app!

Thank you for your time, and we look forward to transforming the way you travel!

And remember:
"To get there speedy, talk to GENIE!"
