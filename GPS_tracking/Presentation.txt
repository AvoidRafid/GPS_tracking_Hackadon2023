PITCH TALK:


The Miracle of Those Chasing Time:

Like millions of others navigating the hustle of catching every day, I too was living my own story in this modern world where time is of the essence. Buses arriving at the last minute, followed by the anxiety of missing them – these troubles had become a part of this urban life.

Some of us frequently missing buses and racing against time to catch them at the last minute. Every day, some embarked on the quest to make it to work or somewhere else on time, yet sometimes we couldn’t make it.

What if I could track buses in real-time?
What if I could have instant information about where they are headed and the routes they are on? 


At this point, we came together as a team and sought a solution to eliminate the daily struggles we faced.
Our team “INTFINITY” came up with an idea ,with the purpose of assisting those racing against time every day, and to enhance functionality and usability for transport navigation users.

Our project allowed tracking buses on bus routes in real-time, so that users know where they were at any given moment.


Now, instead of worrying about missing buses and being late, 
we embark on a journey filled with real-time information.
With this project, we took a step towards making every moment more valuable and enhancing our quality of life. 
Even we can run to bus stop when we are talking with our voice assistant GENIE :).


Perhaps this story is not just mine; maybe you are experiencing the same struggles. 
However, this project is not just a bus tracking system; it can also be a beacon of hope for everyone chasing time.









PRESENTATION IDEAS:
Hello everyone,
Having the power to track the location of your bus in real-time, allowing you to make more informed decisions about your daily travel.


1. Geopoints Generator Function:
Our application starts with a sophisticated geopoints generator function. We use the capabilities of the Open Source Routing Machine, we create precise geopoints that represent the optimal route for you. This ensures that the routes are not only accurate but also efficiently generated for your travel with personal vehicle.


2. Traffic Jam Detection:
What sets us apart is our ability to analyze traffic conditions in real-time. By integrating various datasets, we monitor these geopoints for any signs of traffic congestion. This allows us to pinpoint potential delays and disruptions in the bus route with a color. Green to vicious red.


3. Interactive Map Display:
The information gathered is then seamlessly presented on an interactive map. Users can easily visualize the current location of active buses and identify areas of traffic congestion. This intuitive display makes it convenient for commuters to plan their journeys more effectively.
